### Network Device Management

ANC leverages Ansible to handle the provisioning and management of all ANC network devices. Ansible uses ssh protocols to connect to network devices and reports back with configuration statuses after a config has been changed. Ansible uses playbooks to handle multiple task deployments. 

Various files from the ANC network monitor PRTG on ANCNETMON sends information in the form of csv and xml files for the continued operation of the network automation.
