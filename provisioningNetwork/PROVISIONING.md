# ANC Provisioning DEV Network Documentation

## Description

This document is here to provide insight on the ANC server provisioning process. 

To speed up the process of provisioning new servers to ANC IT systems, ANC IT has leveraged the use of server management software. 

Currently, as of 5/8/20, ANC is using HPE MPM - Moonshot for provisioning of HPe Proliant servers as well as concurrently running Ansible Playbooks for deploying Docker container engines.
